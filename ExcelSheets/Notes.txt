CPG and Outside workbooks are generated upon running metadataExtract.py: the script goes through the 'photos' folder inside the root, looking for any subfolders with names 'Outside', '4545', 'W45', 'W46', 'PDL', 'CPG', 'Haggot', 'McMahon', 'S1', 'PBG' to extract coordinates from. 

The 'ParkingGarage' workbook seems to contain the coordinates for each parking gargage on the map as well as the icons that each correlates to.
